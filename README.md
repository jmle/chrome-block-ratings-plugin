Wikipedia album ratings blocker
===============================
Small Chrome extension to block professional ratings from appearing on Wikipedia music album pages. I created this extension after getting tired of being influenced by other people's (critic's) opinions about music.

Installation
------------
1. Clone the repository
2. Go to Chrome extension settings and select **Developer mode**
3. Select **Load unpacked extension** and navigate to the repository folder
4. The extension should appear automatically in your extensions bar
